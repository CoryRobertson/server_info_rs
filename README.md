# Server Info rs

At the moment, the program is feature complete, I am implementing polish where ever possible but am mostly done with it. :)

This is a re-write of another program I made called server info, a system resource monitor written using java sockets. 
My goals with this repo are to remake that program as closely as I can in terms of features, using rust instead of java out of pure enjoyment!
